<p>In my garden, where the rose</p>
<p>By the hundred gaily blows,</p>
<p>And the river freshly flows</p>

<p>I can spend the summer day</p>
<p>In a quite idyllic way;</p>
<p>Simply charming, you would say,</p>
<p class="i4">Could you see.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>I am far from stuffy town,</p>

<p>And the air seems&mdash;being brown&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Close to me.</p>

<p>But one grievance I have there;</p>
<p class="i4">Close to me,</p>
<p>As I sit and idly dream,</p>
<p>Clammy corpses ever seem</p>
<p>Floating down the placid stream</p>
<p class="i4">To the sea.</p>

<p>Though the boats that crowd the lock&mdash;</p>

<p>Float defunct and dismal dogs</p>
<p class="i4">There <i>aussi</i>.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>As in Egypt at a feast,</p>

<h2>THE VOLUNTEER&#39;S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Bisley Edition.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Question.</i> What is the ambition of every
rifleman?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Answer.</i> To become an expert marksman.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> How is this to be done?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> By practice at the regimental butts
(where such accommodation exists), and appearing
at Bisley.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Is the new site of the National Rifle
Association better than the last?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Certainly, for those who come to Bisley
intend to shoot.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> But did any one turn up at Wimbledon
for any purpose other than marksmanship?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, for many of those who occupied the
tents used their <i>marquees</i> merely as a suitable
resting-place for light refreshments.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Is there anything of that kind at Bisley?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Not much, as the nearest place of interest
is a crematorium, and the most beautiful
grounds in the neighbourhood belong to a
cemetery.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Then the business of Bisley is shooting?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Distinctly. Without the rifle, the place
would be as melancholy as its companion
spot, Woking.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> In this place of useful work, what is
the first object of the marksman?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> To score heavily, if possible; but, at
any rate, to score.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Is it necessary to appear in uniform?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> That depends upon the regulations
commanding the prize competitions.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> What is uniform?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> As much or as little of the dress of a
corps that a judge will order a marksman to
adopt.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> If some marksmen were paraded with
their own corps, how would they look?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> They would appear to be a sorry sight.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Why would they appear to be a sorry
sight?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Because over a tunic would appear a
straw hat, and under a pouch-belt fancy
tweed trousers.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> But surely if the Volunteers are anxious
to improve themselves they will practise
&quot;smartness&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> But they do not want to promote smartness;
they want to win cups, or the value of
cups.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> What is the greatest reward that a
marksman can obtain?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Some hundreds of pounds.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> And the smallest?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> A dozen of somebody&#39;s champagne, or
a box of someone else&#39;s soap.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Under all the circumstances of the case,
what would be an appropriate rule for Bisley?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Look after the cup-winning, and everything
else will take care of itself.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;All the world&#39;s upon the stage,</p>
<p>And here and there you really get a player:</p>
<p>The exits rather than the entrances</p>
<p>Are regulated by the County Council;</p>
<p>And one man in a season sees a lot&mdash;</p>
<p>Seven plays a week, including <i>matinées</i>,</p>
<p>And several acts in each. And first the infant,</p>
<p>A vernal blossom of the Garrick Caste,</p>
<p>Playing the super in his bassinet,</p>
<p>And innocently causing some chagrin</p>
<p>To Mr. <span class="smcap">Eccles</span>. Then there&#39;s <i>Archibald</i>,</p>
<p><i>New Boy</i>, and nearly father to the man,</p>
<p>With mourning on his face and kicks behind,</p>
<p>Returning under strong connubial stress</p>
<p>Unwillingly to school. And next the lover,</p>
<p>Sighing like <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> for fresh fields,</p>
<p>And plunging wofully to win a kiss,</p>
<p>Even to his very eyebrows. Then the soldier,</p>
<p>Armed with strange maxims and a carpet-bag,</p>
<p>Cock-Shaw in military ironies,</p>
<p>And blowing off the bubbling repartee</p>
<p>With chocolate in his mouth. And next is <i>Falstaff</i>,</p>
<p>In fair round belly with good bolsters lined,</p>
<p>Full of wide sores, and badly cut about</p>
<p>By Windsor hussies,&mdash;modern instances</p>
<p>Of the revolting woman. Sixthly, <i>Charley&#39;s Aunt</i>.</p>
<p>Now ancient as the earth, and shifting still</p>
<p>The Penley pantaloons for ladies&#39; gear,</p>
<p>Her fine heroic waist a world too wide</p>
<p>For the slim corset, and her manly lips,</p>
<p>Tuned to the treble of a maiden&#39;s pipe,</p>
<p>Grasping a big cigar. Last scene of all,</p>
<p>The season&#39;s close and mere oblivion;</p>
<p>Away to Europe and the provinces;</p>
<p>And London left forlorn without them all,</p>
<p><i>Sans-Gêne</i>, <i>Santuzza</i>, yea, <i>sans</i> everything.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Bless my old bones!&mdash;they&#39;re weary ones, wherefore I takes small shame&mdash;</p>
<p>For the first time for many a year mine <i>looks</i> a winning game!</p>
<p>A &quot;bumper&quot; harvest? Blissful thought! For long I&#39;ve been fair stuck,</p>
<p>But now I really hope I see a change in my bad luck.</p>
<p>True, my opponent is a chap &#39;tis doosed hard to match.</p>
<p>I seed a picture once of one a playing &#39;gainst Old Scratch,</p>
<p>And oftentimes I feels like that, a-sticking all together,</p>
<p>Against that demon-dicer whom we know as British Weather!</p>
<p>What use of ploughs and patience, boys, or skill, and seed, and sickle,</p>
<p>&#39;Gainst frost, and rain, and blighted grain, and all that&#39;s foul and fickle?</p>
<p>When the fly is on the turmuts, and the blight is on the barley,</p>
<p>And meadows show like sodden swamps, a farmer do get snarley.</p>
<p>But now the crops from hay to hops show promising of plenty,</p>
<p>A-doubling last year&#39;s average, plus a extry ten or twenty.</p>
<p>And straw is good, uncommon so, and barley, wheat and oats, Sir,</p>
<p>Make a rare show o&#39;er whose rich glow the long-tried farmer gloats, Sir!</p>
<p>Beans ain&#39;t so bad, spite o&#39; May frosts; turnips and swedes look topping;</p>
<p>Though the frost and fly the mangolds try, and the taters won&#39;t be whopping.</p>
<p>Those poor unlucky taters! If there&#39;s any mischief going,</p>
<p>They cop their share, and how they&#39;ll fare this year there ain&#39;t no knowing;</p>
<p>And peas is good, and hops is bad, or baddish. But, by jingo!</p>
<p>The sight o&#39; the hay as I saw to-day is as good as a glass of stingo.</p>
<p>Pastures and meadows promise prime, well nigh the country over,</p>
<p>Though them as depend on their clover-crop will hardly be in clover.</p>
<p>But take &#39;em all, the big and small, the cereals, roots, and grasses,</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lump o&#39; cheer for the farmers&#39; hearts, and the farmers&#39; wives and lasses;</p>
<p>If only him I&#39;m playing against&mdash;well, p&#39;r&#39;aps I&#39;d best be civil,&mdash;</p>
<p>If he isn&#39;t <span class="smcap">Jemmy Squarefoot</span> though, he has the <i>luck</i> o&#39; the divil.</p>
<p>With his rain and storm and cold and hot, and his host of insect horrors,</p>
<p>He has the pull, and our bright to-days may be spiled by black to-morrers.</p>
<p>A cove like him with looks so grim, and flies, and such philistians,</p>
<p>Is no fair foe for farmer chaps as is mortial men and Christians.</p>
<p>Look at him damply glowering there with a eye like a hungry vulture!</p>
<p>With his blights at hand, and his floods to command, he&#39;s the scourge of Agriculture.</p>
<p>But howsomever, although he&#39;s clever, luck&#39;s all, and mine seems turning,</p>
<p>Oh! for a few more fair fine weeks, not swamped, nor yet too burning,</p>
<p>When the sun shines sweet on the slanting wheat, with the bees through the clover humming,</p>
<p>And us farmer chaps with a cheery heart <i>will</i> sing &quot;<i>There&#39;s a good time coming!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She believes in nothing but herself, and never accepts her own
personality seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">She has aspirations after the impossible, and is herself far from

children as disturbances without compensating advantages.</p>

<p class="indent">She writes more than she reads and seldom scribbles anything.</p>

<p class="indent">She has no feelings, and yet has a yearning after the intense.</p>

<p class="indent">She is the antithesis of her grandmother, and has made further
development in generations to come quite impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">She thinks without the thoughts of a male, and yet has lost the
comprehension of a female.</p>

sunk several fathoms below the level of a woman.</p>

of labour&mdash;Shoemaker with two apprentices&mdash;and his hands. One
apprentice won&#39;t work with t&#39;other. Shoemaker locked out both.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Later News.</i>&mdash;Dispute developing. Amalgamated Association of
Trade Unions sent fifty thousand men with rifles into town. Also
park of artillery. Arbitration suggested.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Special Telegram.</i>&mdash;Federated Society of Masters occupying Market
Place and principal streets with Gatling guns. Expresses itself
willing to accept Arbitration in principle.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A Day After.</i>&mdash;Conflicts to-day between opposing forces. Streets
resemble battle-field. Authorities announce&mdash;&quot;will shortly act with
vigour.&quot; Enrolled ten extra policemen. Police, including extra ten,
captured by rioters, and locked up in their own cells. Business&mdash;except
of undertakers&mdash;at standstill.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Latest Developments.</i>&mdash;More conflicts, deaths, outrages, incendiarism.
Central Government telegraphs to Shoemaker to take back
both apprentices to stop disastrous disorder. No reply. Shoemaker
and both apprentices been killed in riots.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Close of the Struggle.</i>&mdash;Stock of gunpowder exhausted. Both
sides inclined to accept compromise. Board of Conciliation formed.
Survivors of employers and employed shake hands. Town irretrievably
ruined, but peace firmly re-established.</p>

the influenza? I think you&#39;ll find I&#39;m right.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">PART III.&mdash;THE TWO ANDROMEDAS.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>Opposite a Railway Bookstall at a London Terminus.</i>
<span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday</i>, 4.25 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drysdale</i> (<i>to his friend</i>, <span class="smcap">Galfrid Undershell</span>, <i>whom he is
&quot;seeing off&quot;</i>). Twenty minutes to spare; time enough to lay in any
quantity of light literature.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Undershell (in a head voice).</i> I fear the merely ephemeral does not
appeal to me. But I should like to make a little experiment. (<i>To
the Bookstall Clerk.</i>) A&mdash;do you happen to have a copy left of
<span class="smcap">Clarion Blair&#39;s</span> <i>Andromeda</i>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Clerk.</i> Not in stock, Sir. Never &#39;eard of the book, but daresay
I could get it for you. Here&#39;s a Detective Story we&#39;re sellin&#39; like
&#39;ot cakes&mdash;<i>The Man with the Missing Toe</i>&mdash;very cleverly written
story, Sir.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I merely wished to know&mdash;that was all. (<i>Turning with
resigned disgust to</i> <span class="smcap">Drysdale</span>.) Just think of it, my dear fellow. At a
bookstall like this one feels the pulse,
as it were, of Contemporary Culture;
and here my <i>Andromeda</i>, which no
less an authority than the <i>Daily
Chronicle</i> hailed as the uprising of a
new and splendid era in English Songmaking,
a Poetic Renascence, my poor
<i>Andromeda</i> is trampled underfoot by&mdash;(<i>choking</i>)&mdash;Men
with Missing Toes!
What a satire on our so-called Progress!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> That a purblind public should
prefer a Shilling Shocker for railway
reading when for a modest half-guinea
they might obtain a numbered volume
of Coming Poetry on hand-made paper!
It <i>does</i> seem incredible,&mdash;but they do.
Well, if they can&#39;t read <i>Andromeda</i>
on the journey, they can at least peruse
a stinger on it in this week&#39;s <i>Saturday</i>.
Seen it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> No. I don&#39;t vex my soul by
reading criticisms on my work. I am
no <span class="smcap">Keats</span>. They may howl&mdash;but they
will not kill <i>me</i>. By the way, the
<i>Speaker</i> had a most enthusiastic notice
last week.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> So you saw <i>that</i> then? But
you&#39;re right not to mind the others.
When a fellow&#39;s contrived to hang
on to the Chariot of Fame, he can&#39;t
wonder if a few rude and envious
beggars call out &quot;Whip behind!&quot; eh?
You don&#39;t want to get in yet? Suppose
we take a turn up to the end of
the platform.</p>

Riding Masters, Mayfair</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurrell.</i> Yes, it&#39;s lucky for me old
<span class="smcap">Spavin</span> being laid up like this&mdash;gives
me a regular little outing, do you see?
going down to a swell place like this
Wyvern Court, and being put up there for a day or two! I shouldn&#39;t
wonder if they do you very well in the housekeeper&#39;s room. (<i>To</i> Clerk.)
Give me a <i>Pink &#39;Un</i> and last week&#39;s <i>Dog Fancier&#39;s Guide</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Clerk.</i> We&#39;ve returned the unsold copies. Could give you <i>this</i>
week&#39;s; or there&#39;s <i>The Rabbit and Poultry Breeder&#39;s Journal</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> Oh, rabbits be blowed! (To <span class="smcap">Tanrake</span>.) I wanted you to
see that notice they put in of <i>Andromeda</i> and me, with my photo
and all; it said she was the best bull-bitch they&#39;d seen for many a
day, and fully deserved her first prize.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tanrake.</i> She&#39;s a rare good bitch, and no mistake. But what
made you call her such an outlandish name?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> Well, I <i>was</i> going to call her <i>Sal</i>; but a chap at the
College thought the other would look more stylish if I ever meant to
exhibit her. <i>Andromeda</i> was one of them Roman goddesses, you know.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tanr.</i> Oh, I knew <i>that</i> right enough. Come and have a drink
before you start&mdash;just for luck&mdash;not that you want <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> I&#39;m lucky enough in most things, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>; in everything
except love. I told you about that girl, you know&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emma</span>&mdash;and
my being as good as engaged to her, and then, all of a sudden, she
went off abroad and I&#39;ve never seen or had a line from her since.
Can&#39;t call <i>that</i> luck, you know. Well, I won&#39;t say no to a glass of
something.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to</i> Footman). Get a compartment for us, and two
foot-warmers, and a second-class as near ours as you can for
<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>; then come back here. Stay, I&#39;d better give you
<span class="smcap">Phillipson&#39;s</span> ticket. (<i>The</i> Footman <i>disappears in the crowd.</i>) Now
we must get something to read on the journey. (<i>To</i> Clerk.) I want a
book of some sort&mdash;no rubbish, mind; something serious and
improving, and <i>not</i> a work of fiction.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Clerk.</i> Exactly so, Ma&#39;am. Let me see. Ah, here&#39;s <i>Alone with
the &#39;Airy Ainoo</i>. How would you like <i>that</i>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>with decision</i>). I should not like it at all.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Clerk.</i> I quite understand. Well, I can give you <i>Three &#39;Undred
Ways of Dressing the Cold Mutton</i>&mdash;useful little book for a family,
redooced to one and ninepence.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Thank you. I think I will wait until I am reduced
to one and ninepence.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Clerk.</i> Precisely. What do you say to <i>Seven &#39;Undred Side-splitters
for Sixpence</i>? &#39;Ighly yumorous, I assure you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Are these times to split our sides, with so many
serious social problems pressing for
solution? You are presumably not
without intelligence; do you never
reflect upon the responsibility you
incur in assisting to circulate trivial
and frivolous trash of this sort?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Clerk</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Well, I can&#39;t
say as I do, particular, Ma&#39;am. I&#39;m
paid to sell the books&mdash;I don&#39;t <i>select</i>
&#39;em.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> That is <i>no</i> excuse for
you&mdash;you ought to exercise some discrimination
on your own account,
instead of pressing people to buy what
can do them no possible good. You
can give me a <i>Society Snippets</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Mamma! A penny
paper that says such rude things about
the Royal Family!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> It&#39;s always instructive
to know what these creatures are saying
about one, my dear, and it&#39;s astonishing
how they manage to find out
the things they do. Ah, here&#39;s <span class="smcap">Gravener</span>
coming back. He&#39;s got us a
carriage, and we&#39;d better get in.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>She and her daughter enter a first-class
compartment</i>; <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Drysdale</span> <i>return</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). Well, I
don&#39;t see now where the insolence
comes in. These people have invited
you to stay with them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> But why? Not because they
appreciate my work&mdash;which they probably
only half understand&mdash;but out
of mere idle curiosity to see what
manner of strange beast a Poet may
be! And <i>I</i> don&#39;t know this Lady
<span class="smcap">Culverin</span>&mdash;never met her in my life!
What the deuce does she mean by
sending me an invitation? Why
should these smart women suppose
that they are entitled to send for a
Man of Genius, as if he was their <i>lackey?</i> Answer me that!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> Perhaps the delusion is encouraged by the fact that Genius
occasionally condescends to answer the bell.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>reddening</i>). Do you imagine I am going down to this place
simply to please <i>them</i>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> I should think it a doubtful kindness, in your present frame
of mind; and, as you are hardly going to please yourself, wouldn&#39;t
it be more dignified, on the whole, not to go at all?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> You never <i>did</i> understand me! Sometimes I think I was
born to be misunderstood! But you might do me the justice to
believe that I am not going from merely snobbish motives. May
I not feel that such a recognition as this is a tribute less to my poor
self than to Literature, and that, as such, I have scarcely the <i>right</i>
to decline it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> Ah, if you put it in that way, I am silenced, of course.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Or what if I am going to show these Patricians that&mdash;Poet
of the People as I am&mdash;they can neither patronise nor cajole me?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> Exactly, old chap&mdash;what if you <i>are</i>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I don&#39;t say that I may not have another reason&mdash;a&mdash;a rather
romantic one&mdash;but you would only sneer if I told you! I know you
think me a poor creature whose head has been turned by an undeserved
success.</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page029" id="page029"></a>[pg&nbsp;029]</span>
<i>Drys.</i> You&#39;re not going to try to pick a quarrel with an old chum,
are you? Come, you know well enough I don&#39;t think anything of the
sort. I&#39;ve always said you had the right stuff in you, and would
show it some day; there are even signs of it in <i>Andromeda</i> here and
there; but you&#39;ll do better things than that, if you&#39;ll only let some
of the wind out of your head. I like you, old fellow, and that&#39;s
just why it riles me to see you taking yourself so devilish seriously
on the strength of a little volume of verse which has been &quot;boomed&quot;
for all it&#39;s worth, and considerably more. You&#39;ve only got your
immortality on a short repairing lease at present, old boy!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>with bitterness</i>). I am fortunate in possessing such a candid
friend. But I mustn&#39;t keep you here any longer.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> Very well. I suppose you&#39;re going first? Consider the
feelings of the <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> footman at the other end!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> (<i>as he fingers a first-class ticket in his pocket</i>). You have a
very low view of human nature! (<i>Here he remarks a remarkably
pretty face at a second-class window close by.</i>) As it <i>happens</i>, I am
travelling second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">[<i>He gets in.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Drys.</i> (<i>at the window</i>). Well, good-bye, old chap. Good luck to
you at Wyvern, and remember&mdash;wear your livery with as good a
grace as possible.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I do not intend to wear any livery whatever.</p>

with all my exes. paid? Not <i>likely</i>! I&#39;m going to travel in style

<h2>THE LATEST GREAT YACHT RACE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By our own Nautical Special.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The captain went on board the gallant <i>Naughty Lass</i>
with his Wind Lass. A Wind Lass is short for &quot;Winn&#39;d Lass,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>
a Lass he has won. I think her name is &quot;<span class="smcap">Poll</span>.&quot; The Captain says
he is always true to her, and nothing will ever induce him to leave
his dear Wind Lass ashore when he&#39;s afloat. Noble sentiment, but
unpractical. The fact is (as whispered) the Wind Lass is jealous of the
<i>Naughty Lass</i>, and won&#39;t let the Captain go alone. When the other
Captain went on board the rival of the gallant <i>Naughty Lass</i>, the
<i>Anne Nemone</i>, and &quot;the crafty ones,&quot; as they call the sailors &quot;in the
know,&quot; were ready to bet any money on the <i>Anne Nemone</i>. Both
cutters &quot;cut&quot; (hence the name) well away from each other at the
start, and a fresh breeze coming up (the stale one had been got rid of)
there was a lot of fore-reaching, until the Captain, who is an old hand
at this sort of thing, sent round steward with brandy. &quot;All hands for
grog!&quot; was then the order of the day, and we just managed to clear
Muddle Point, leaving the home-marked (or &quot;home-made,&quot; I forget
which is the technical term, but I suppose the latter, as she was
built on the neighbouring premises) boat well to windward. After a
free reach in this weather down to Boot Shore&mdash;where the vessel
heeled over a bit, but nothing to speak of, as it was soon remedied
by a cobble that was close at hand&mdash;the <i>Naughty Lass</i> lifted her
head-sails, and away we went for Incog Bay, where nobody knew
us, or we should have been received with three times three.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the <i>Anne Nemone</i>, racing close to us, let out a
right good &quot;gybe,&quot; which was in execrable taste, I admit, but which
ought not to have called for any retort from the captain&#39;s Wind
Lass, who gave it her hot and strong, and threatened to haul her over
the coal-scuttlers. Fortunately we were away again, and there was
no time for opposite gybes. (I spell &quot;gybes&quot; in the old English
nautical fashion, but, as I ascertain, it is precisely the same as &quot;jibes.&quot;)
Sailors&#39; language is a bit odd; they don&#39;t mean anything, I know&mdash;it&#39;s
only professional; still, as reporting the matter to ears polite,
I scarcely like to set down in full <i>all</i> I heard. At 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> all hands
were piped for luncheon, and we had spinnakers cooked in their skins
(they are a sort of bean), with a rare nautical dish called &quot;Booms
and Bacon.&quot; Fine! I did enjoy it! But then I&#39;m an old hand at
this sort of thing,&mdash;luncheon on board, I mean; for there&#39;s scarcely
a board, be it sea board or other board, or, in fact, any boarding
establishment, that I don&#39;t know. But &quot;yeo ho! my boys! and
avast!&quot; for are we not still racing? We are!!</p>

<p class="indent">We passed The Bottle at 2.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> What had become of the
<i>Anne Nemone</i> I don&#39;t know, and probably we should never have
seen her again had not our captain, who was trying to sight the
port after passing The Bottle, stood on the wrong tack, which ran
into his boot and hurt him awfully. He was carried below, and we
gathered round him as he turned to the <i>Naughty Lass</i> and murmured&mdash;but
<span class="smcap">Polly</span> objected that there was nothing to murmur about
or to grumble at, and that the sooner he stumbled on deck the
better it would be for the race. So up rose our brave captain, took a
stiff draught of weather bilge (which is the best preventive of sea-sickness),
and calling for his first mate, Mr. <span class="smcap">Jack Yard Topsail</span>,
told him to &quot;stand away,&quot; which I could quite understand, for <span class="smcap">Jack
Yard Topsail</span> is a regular salt, full of tar, rum, &#39;baccy, and everything
that can make life sweet to <i>him</i>, but not to his immediate neighbours.
So &quot;stand away&quot; and not &quot;stand by&quot; it was, and when we
got to Squeams Bay the sailors took a short hitch (it is necessary occasionally&mdash;but
I cannot say more&mdash;lady-readers being present), and we
went streaking away like a side of bacon on a fine day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are we winning?&quot; asks <span class="smcap">Polly</span>, the Wind Lass. &quot;<i>You</i> look
winning!&quot; I reply, politely. &quot;By how much?&quot; she inquires, just
tucking up her skirts, and showing a trim ankle. The Captain, with
his glass to his eye, and looking down, answers, &quot;The fifth of a long
leg!&quot; I never saw a woman so angry! &quot;I haven&#39;t!&quot; she exclaimed;
and there would have been a row, and we should never have won, as
we did splendidly, had not the &quot;First Officer&quot; (just as they name the
supernumeraries in a play) come up and reminded Pretty <span class="smcap">Polly</span> that
she wasn&#39;t the only mate the Captain had on board. &quot;Where&#39;s the
other?&quot; she cried, in a fury. &quot;Below!&quot; answered the First Officer,
and down went <span class="smcap">Polly</span>, not to re-appear again until all was over, and
our victorious binnacle was waving proudly from the fore-top-gallant.
At the finish we went clean into harbour, without a speck on our
forecastle, or a stain on our character. I wire you the account of
this great race, and am (Rule <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>!)</p>

<p class="right">Yours,<br />
&quot;<span class="smcap">Every Other Inch a Sailor!</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">P.S.&mdash;I am informed that after I left the vessel&mdash;in fact it was
next day&mdash;a Burgee was run up at the mast head. I suppose some
sort of court-martial was held first, and that the Burgee (poor
wretch!) was caught red-handed. Still, in these days, this sort of
proceeding does sound rather tyrannical. High-masted justice, eh?
Well, sea-dogs will be sea-dogs. I don&#39;t exactly know what a Burgee
is, but I fancy he is something between a Buccaneer and a Bargee;
a sort of river-and-sea pirate. But I fear it is a landsman!!
Burgee, masculine (and probably husband) of Burgess!! If so, there
<i>will</i> be a row!</p>

<p class="right">Yours as Before the Mast.</p>

<h2>THE MINX.&mdash;A POEM IN PROSE.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> It&#39;s so good of you to see
me. I merely wished to ask one or
two questions as to your career. You
must have led a most interesting life.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;">
<img width="100%" src="images/033.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> You are very inquisitive
and extremely indiscreet, and I have
always carefully avoided being interviewed.
However, go on.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> I believe you can read hieroglyphs?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> Oh yes; I <i>can</i>, fluently,
But I never do. I assure you they
are not in the least amusing.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> No doubt you have talked
with hippogriffs and basilisks?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx</i> (<i>modestly</i>). I certainly <i>was</i>
in rather a smart set at one time. As
they say, I have &quot;known better days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> Did you ever have any conversation
with <span class="smcap">Thoth</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx</i> (<i>loftily</i>). Oh, dear no!
(<i>Mimicking.</i>) Thoth he wath not conthidered
quite a nice perthon. I would
not allow him to be introduced to me.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> You were very particular?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> One has to be careful.
The world is so censorious.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> I wonder, would you give
me the pleasure of singing to me?
&quot;<i>Adrian&#39;s Gilded Barge</i>,&quot; for
instance?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> You must really excuse
me. I am not in good voice. By the
way, the &quot;Gilded Barge,&quot; as you
call it, was merely a shabby sort of
punt. It would have had no effect
whatever at the Henley Regatta.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> Dear me! Is it true you
played golf among the Pyramids?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx</i> (<i>emphatically</i>). Perfectly
untrue. You see what absurd reports
get about!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet</i> (<i>softly</i>). They do. What was
that story about the Tyrian?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> Merely gossip. There was
nothing in it, I assure you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> And <span class="smcap">Apis</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> Oh, he sent me some
flowers, and there were paragraphs
about it&mdash;in hieroglyphs&mdash;in the
society papers. That was all. But
they were contradicted.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> You knew <span class="smcap">Ammon</span> very
well, I believe?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx</i> (<i>frankly</i>). <span class="smcap">Ammon</span> and I
<i>were</i> great pals. I used to see a
good deal of him. He came in to tea
very often&mdash;he was <i>quite</i> interesting.
But I have not seen him for a long
time. He had one fault&mdash;he <i>would</i>
smoke in the drawing-room. And
though I hope I am not too conventional,
I really could not allow <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> How pleased they would all
be to see you again! Why do you
not go over to Egypt for the winter?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> The hotels at Cairo are so
dreadfully expensive.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> Is it true you went tunny-fishing
with <span class="smcap">Antony</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx.</i> One must draw the line
somewhere! <span class="smcap">Cleopatra</span> was so cross.
She was horribly jealous, and not
nearly so handsome as you might suppose,
though she <i>was</i> photographed
as a &quot;type of Egyptian Beauty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> I must thank you very much
for the courteous way in which you
have replied to my questions. And
now will you forgive me if I make
an observation? In my opinion you
are not a Sphinx at all.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sphinx</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). What am I,
then?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Poet.</i> A Minx.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="indent">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Lords, Monday, July 9.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Playfair&#39;s</span> leonine countenance
habitually cheerful. But never saw him looking so pleased
as when we walked through St. Stephen&#39;s Chapel on way to Lords just
now. &quot;From point of view of old House of Commons man the Lords
are, I admit, a little unresponsive,&quot; my Lord said. &quot;The chamber is,
acoustically and otherwise, the sepulchre of speech. You remember
the little lecture on
margarine I delivered
years ago in the Commons?
Bless me, how
delighted the House
was to see the table
covered with small
white pots containing
samples, with a bottle
of best Dorset margarine
hooked on to the
Mace for greater convenience
of reference.
Often I&#39;ve enchained
an audience with my
object lessons. Up to
present time that monologue
on margarine
ranks as most successful.
But I&#39;ll beat
the record to-night.
See that?&quot; (Here he
slapped a something
bulging out from his
trouser pocket.)
&quot;Guess what that is?
Thought you couldn&#39;t.
It&#39;s cultch. Know
what cultch is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not unless it&#39;s
the beginning of knowledge,&quot;
I said, drawing
a bow, so to speak,
at a venture. &quot;Positive
cultch, comparative
culture, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Playfair</span> stared at
me vacantly. &quot;Cultch&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
he said; &quot;but
no, that&#39;s part of the
lecture. Come along to
the Lords and hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">No. I.&mdash;&quot;The Majesty of the Law!&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">House not in condition particularly inspiring for lecturer.
Benches mostly empty; <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> of Alderley completed depletion by
rambling speech of half an hour&#39;s duration, modestly described in
Orders as &quot;a question.&quot; Wanted to know how many lighthouses in
England and Wales paid Income Tax; how many were behindhand
with their rates; were Death Duties applicable to some of them; if
so, which; and whether the tenants compounded for rates or otherwise.
These inquiries not without interest, but <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> not chiefly
remarkable for concentration of thought or conciseness of phrase.</p>

<p class="indent">At length <span class="smcap">Playfair&#39;s</span> turn came. A flutter of interest amongst
Peers as he was observed tugging at something in trousers pocket;
hauled out what looked like empty oyster shell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said <span class="smcap">Herschell</span>, smiling, &quot;I see the lawyers have been
before us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In moving the Second Reading of the Sea Fisheries (Shell Fish)
Bill, I propose, if I may be permitted, to give your Lordships
an object lesson. This particular shell,&quot; <span class="smcap">Playfair</span> continued,
holding it up between finger and thumb, &quot;is covered all over with
microscopic oysters. Oysters in all stages of growth are seen there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said the <span class="smcap">Marquis of Carabas</span>, &quot;if one had a twenty
billion magnifying glass of the kind associated with the memory of
<i>Sam Weller</i>, perhaps we might see the oysters. All I can say is, I
don&#39;t see any worth three and sixpence a dozen. <span class="smcap">Playfair</span>&#39;s no
business to bring these things down here, filling House with smell
of stale seaweed when his oysters are no bigger than a pin&#39;s head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="smcap">Marquis</span> strode angrily forth. Others followed. Lecture cut
short.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Sea Fisheries (Shell Fish) Bill read a second time,
amid unexpectedly depressing circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> back after
a week&#39;s rustication. Brings glowing news of the hay crop; looks,
indeed, as if he had been helping to make it; ruddier than a
cherry; indescribable but unmistakable country air about him as
he sits on Treasury Bench with folded arms, listening to the monotonous
ripple of talk renewed on Budget Bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">says <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>, looking across at the rustic Squire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<i>At ille</i></p>

<p class="indent">Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis ævum,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">added <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>, with approving glance at bench behind, where the
Busy B.&#39;s swarm after week&#39;s rest, humming round amendments
with increased vigour.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost imperceptible movement of river goes forward. The
blameless <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> on his feet, entrancing House with particulars of
a silver cup, prized heirloom in the humble household in Victoria
Street. It seems that one of <span class="smcap">Bartley&#39;s</span> ancestors&mdash;he who came over
with the Conqueror&mdash;had brought with him certain blades of buckwheat,
which he industriously planted out on the site, then a meadow,
on which the Army and Navy Stores now flourish. The buckwheat
grew apace. One day King <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, passing by on a palfrey, noted
the waving green expanse. Enquiring to whom the State was
indebted for this fair prospect, a courtier informed him that it was
&quot;the ancestor of <span class="smcap">George Christopher Trout Bartley</span>, Member
for North Islington in the thirteenth Parliament of Queen <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By our sooth,&quot; said the King, &quot;he shall have a silver cup.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One was forthwith requisitioned from the nearest silversmith&#39;s,
and this it is which now adorns the sideboard in the best parlour at
St. Margaret&#39;s House, Victoria Street, S.W.</p>

<p class="indent">These interesting reminiscences of family history <span class="smcap">George Christopher
Trout</span> recited to a charmed House in support of proposed
new Clause, moved by <span class="smcap">Dick Webster</span>, exempting from estate duty
heirlooms under settlement. <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>, usually impervious
to argument in favour of alterations in his prized Budget,
evidently moved. If <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> had only thought of bringing the cup
with him, had at this moment produced it from under his cloak, and
flashed it forth on gaze of House, the Clause would have been added,
and the cup, Estate-duty free, would have passed on through the ages,
telling its simple story to successive strata of the <span class="smcap">Bartley</span> family.
As it was, <span class="smcap">Squire</span> stood firm, and <span class="smcap">Webster&#39;s</span> Clause negatived.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Couldn&#39;t do it, my dear <span class="smcap">Webster</span>,&quot; the <span class="smcap">Squire</span> found opportunity
of saying, as he met disappointed legislator behind <span class="smcap">Speaker&#39;s</span>
Chair. &quot;Of course I said the polite thing about <span class="smcap">Bartley&#39;s</span> Cup.
But I wasn&#39;t thinking of that. I know very well what you had in
mind in bringing in this Clause. The heirlooms you thought of are
those cups and medals you won for Cambridge when, twenty-nine
years ago, you met the Oxford Champion in the two-mile race, and
in the one-mile spin. If we could do something in the Schedules
specially exempting them I should be glad. Think it over, and see

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
